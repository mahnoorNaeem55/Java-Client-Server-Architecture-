# Client–Server Architecture in Java

This project implements a **client–server architecture** using **Java socket programming**, developed as part of the **Computer Networks coursework**.

The system enables communication between multiple clients and a central server over TCP, with graphical user interfaces (GUI) provided on both ends for better interaction and usability.

##  Project Overview

The client-server model allows clients to connect to a server, send messages, and receive responses in real time.  
The server is designed to handle multiple clients simultaneously using multithreading, ensuring efficient and scalable communication.

---

##  Key Features

- TCP-based client–server communication
- Multithreaded server to handle multiple clients
- Graphical User Interface (GUI) for both client and server
- Real-time message exchange
- Modular and well-structured Java code

---

##  Technologies Used

- Java  
- Socket Programming (TCP/IP)  
- Java Swing (GUI)  
- Multithreading  

---

##  How to Run the Project

1. Compile all Java source files  
2. Run the "ServerGUI" class first to start the server  
3. Run the "ClientGUI" class to connect one or more clients  
4. Exchange messages between client and server through the GUI
